# YOLO Application Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a containerized application with three main components:
- Frontend client (built with React)
- Backend API server (Ruby on Rails)
- MongoDB database

## Technologies Used
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- React.js for the frontend
- Ruby on Rails for the backend API
- MongoDB for data persistence

## Architecture Design
The application follows a microservices architecture with three separate containers:
1. Client Container: Serves the React frontend application
2. Backend Container: Hosts the Rails API server
3. MongoDB Container: Runs the MongoDB database

## Data Flow
- The client container communicates with the backend container to fetch and update data
- The backend container communicates with the MongoDB container to persist and retrieve data
- All containers are connected via a Docker network

## Configuration Choices
- Used Docker volumes for MongoDB data persistence
- Set up container restart policies to ensure availability
- Configured environment variables for database connection
